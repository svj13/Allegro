This version of Allegro is the fourth iteration out of five sprints (we have been using Scrum).
I have been working on this project with 6 others as a year long project.

Allegro is a musical tutor application that is targeted towards young high school students wishing to learn entry level music, that is compatitible with touch screens.
The application has a transcript where users can look up/add musical terms, and lookup/add/play musical notes, scales or chords. 
The application also have tutors where users can test their musical knowledge.

There is practice mode and competitive mode. In practice mode, all of the tutors are unlocked and you can select the octave range and the amount of questions you are asked. You can access the transcipt, and toggle the keyboard. In competitive mode, you need to unlock the tutors in their chronological order of difficulty, and do not have access to the transcript or keyboard. 

The application supports multiple users, where each user can create an account, upload a display picture and customise the app with a theme.
